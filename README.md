# Power plan manager

## About The Project

I have created this simple app because I was annoyed to always go to the control panel of windows to change the power plan since I dont always want max power.

This app takes the power plans from the windows so if you want to add, modify or remove them, do it in control panel of windows.

## Usage

Download latest release, run it and you should see icon appear in the tray.

To see currently active power plan, hover over the icon.
To change the power plan, right click on the icon and then choose from the list.
